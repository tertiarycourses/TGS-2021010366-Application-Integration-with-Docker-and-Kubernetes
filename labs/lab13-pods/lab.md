# Lab 13: Kubernetes Pods — Imperative & Declarative

**Goal:** Meet the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes — the Pod. You'll create one imperatively with a single command, inspect it, then create one declaratively from a YAML file (the approach you'll use for everything afterwards).

**What you'll build:** Create, inspect and delete a Pod both imperatively and from a pod.yaml manifest.

### Part A — Imperative (one command)

```bash
kubectl run web --image=nginx
kubectl get pods
kubectl get pods -o wide          # node + Pod IP
kubectl describe pod web          # events, container, volumes
```

Look inside the Pod, then remove it:

```bash
kubectl logs web
kubectl exec web -- cat /etc/hostname
kubectl exec -it web -- /bin/sh   # interactive shell, then 'exit'
kubectl delete pod web
```

### Part B — Declarative (pod.yaml)

Real work is declarative: you describe the desired state in YAML and apply it.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: taskboard
  labels:
    app: taskboard
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web
      image: nginx          # swap for <user>/taskboard:1.0 to run your own image
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod taskboard
kubectl delete -f pod.yaml
```

> **Note:** Pods are **ephemeral** — if a Pod dies it is not recreated. That's why you almost always run Pods through a **Deployment** (Lab 15), not on their own.

> ✅ **Test it:** `kubectl get pods` shows the `taskboard` Pod as `Running` after `kubectl apply`, and it disappears after `kubectl delete -f pod.yaml`.
